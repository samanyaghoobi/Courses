# LPIC-1: Session 4 - Hard Disk Layout and Swap Management

## üìå Objectives
- Understand **disk partitioning** in Linux
- Allocate **filesystems** and **swap space**
- Learn **LVM** and **RAID** basics
- Explore **swap** management, including **ZRAM**

## üñ•Ô∏è Linux Filesystem Hierarchy (FHS)
Linux uses a single hierarchical directory structure starting from `/` (root). Some important directories:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/bin` | Essential binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/boot` | Bootloader, kernel, EFI configuration |
| `/dev` | Device files |
| `/etc` | System configuration files |
| `/home` | User home directories |
| `/root` | Root user‚Äôs home directory |
| `/lib`, `/lib64` | Shared libraries |
| `/mnt` | Mount point for temporary filesystems |
| `/opt` | Optional software packages |
| `/srv` | Data for services |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/usr/bin` | User-installed binaries |
| `/var` | Variable data (logs, cache, mail, etc.) |

---

## üîπ Disk Partitions in Linux
Linux doesn‚Äôt use drive letters (C:, D:, etc.), instead, devices are located under `/dev/`.

| Disk Type | Naming Convention |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **SATA, SCSI, NVMe** | `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1` |
| **Partitions** | `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/nvme0n1p1` |
| **USB Drives** | `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc` |

### **Partitioning Schemes**
- **MBR (Master Boot Record)** (BIOS, up to 4 primary partitions)
- **GPT (GUID Partition Table)** (UEFI, supports up to 128 partitions)

---

## üìÇ Mount Points & Partitioning Best Practices
### **Common Partitioning Strategies**
| Partition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Root filesystem (contains everything) |
| `/boot` | Stores bootloader and kernel (100-500MB recommended) |
| `/home` | User home directories (separate for easy backups) |
| `/var` | Logs, databases, and cache (separate on servers) |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (can be separate for security) |
| `swap` | Virtual memory space |

### **Why Separate `/var` on Servers?**
- `/var` stores logs, caches, and databases that can grow indefinitely.
- Prevents system crashes due to disk space exhaustion.
- Easier monitoring and management.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
RAID provides redundancy and performance improvements by combining multiple disks.

### **Common RAID Levels**
| RAID Level | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **RAID 0** | Striping (Improves speed, no redundancy) |
| **RAID 1** | Mirroring (Full redundancy, slower writes) |
| **RAID 5** | Striping with Parity (Balance of speed & redundancy) |
| **RAID 10** | Combination of RAID 1 & 0 (Best for performance & redundancy) |

---

## üîÑ Swap Management (Virtual Memory)
Swap acts as **extra RAM** by using disk space when memory is full.

### **Checking Swap Usage**
```bash
free -h  # Check RAM and Swap usage
swapon --summary  # Show active swap sources
```

### **Three Types of Swap**
1. **Swap Partition** (Traditional, defined during installation)
2. **Swap File** (A file acting as swap space)
3. **ZRAM** (Compressed swap in RAM)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuring Swap
### **Creating a Swap File**
```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile  # Create a 2GB file
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile  # Secure the file
sudo mkswap /swapfile  # Format it as swap
sudo swapon /swapfile  # Enable swap
```

### **Making Swap Permanent**
Add this line to `/etc/fstab`:
```
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

---

## ‚ö° ZRAM: Compressed Swap in RAM
ZRAM compresses swap space to **reduce disk I/O** and **improve performance**.

### **Enable ZRAM**
```bash
sudo modprobe zram  # Load the module
zramctl  # Show active zram devices
```

### **Why Use ZRAM?**
- Reduces swap latency (faster than disk-based swap)
- Saves disk writes (ideal for SSD longevity)
- Works well on low-memory systems

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Linux filesystems** are structured under `/` (root) and follow FHS.
- **Partitions** help organize storage, with `/var` recommended as a separate partition on servers.
- **RAID** improves redundancy and performance.
- **Swap** extends RAM and can be implemented as:
  - A separate **partition**
  - A **swap file**
  - **ZRAM** (compressed swap in RAM)
- **Commands to manage swap**: `free`, `swapon`, `zramctl`
