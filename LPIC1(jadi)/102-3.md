# LPIC-1: Session 5 - Manage Shared Libraries

## üìå Objectives
- Understand the difference between **static** and **dynamic** libraries
- Identify and manage **shared libraries**
- Configure **dynamic linking** and update shared libraries

---

## üîó Static vs. Dynamic Libraries

When developing software, we use **libraries** to provide functionality:

### **Static Linking**
- The required libraries are **embedded** into the executable.
- Results in a **larger file size**.
- The program can run **independently** without requiring external libraries.
- **Disadvantage:** If a library is updated, the program must be **recompiled** to use the new version.

### **Dynamic Linking (Shared Libraries)**
- The program references external **.so (shared object)** files.
- The executable remains **small**.
- **Advantage:** Libraries can be **updated centrally**, and all programs using them benefit.
- **Disadvantage:** The required library **must be installed** on the system.

Linux dynamic libraries follow the naming format:
```bash
libNAME.so.VERSION
```
- Example: `libudev.so.1.4.0`
- Libraries are stored in **`/lib/`, `/lib64/`, `/usr/lib/`, `/usr/lib64/`**

## üìÇ Identifying Shared Libraries
To check which **libraries** a program depends on, use `ldd`:
```bash
ldd /bin/ls
```
Example output:
```bash
linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffdd53eb000)
libselinux.so.1 => /lib64/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f5cbc7b0000)
libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f5cbc5a5000)
```
If `ldd` returns **not a dynamic executable**, the program is **statically linked**.

---

## üîó Symbolic Links for Libraries
To maintain compatibility across versions, symbolic links are used:
```bash
ls -la /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Nov 13 23:05 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 -> libudev.so.1.4.0
```
- This ensures programs expecting **libudev.so.1** can still function with **libudev.so.1.4.0**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring and Managing Dynamic Libraries

### **Dynamic Library Configuration Files**
- The configuration file for dynamic linking is **`/etc/ld.so.conf`**.
- It may include additional configuration directories from **`/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`**.

To check library paths:
```bash
cat /etc/ld.so.conf
tree /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
```

### **Updating the Shared Library Cache**
After modifying shared libraries, update the cache:
```bash
sudo ldconfig -v  # Updates and displays progress
ldconfig -p       # Shows cached libraries
```

---

## üìå Overriding Default Libraries with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
In some cases, you may need to specify **custom library paths**:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/myoldlibs:/home/user/custom_libs/
./my_program
```
- The system will **first search** these directories **before** using system-wide libraries.

---

## üîÑ Loading Libraries Manually
The **dynamic linker** loads shared libraries at runtime:
```bash
locate ld-linux
/usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```
To manually execute a program with its loader:
```bash
/usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/bin/ls
```

**Bonus:** You can execute a program **without** setting the executable bit using `ld-linux`!

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Static libraries** are embedded in executables, making them independent but larger.
- **Dynamic libraries** (`.so`) are shared across programs, reducing size but requiring updates.
- Use `ldd` to check **library dependencies** of an executable.
- **Symbolic links** ensure compatibility between different versions.
- Modify **`/etc/ld.so.conf`** and run `ldconfig` to manage library paths.
- Use **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`** to override default system libraries at runtime.
- The **dynamic linker (`ld-linux`)** loads libraries and executes programs.
