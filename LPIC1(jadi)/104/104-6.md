# LPIC-1: Session 20 - Create and Change Hard and Symbolic Links

## 📌 Objectives
- Create hard and symbolic (soft) links
- Understand differences between hard and soft links
- Use links effectively in system administration

---

## 🔗 What is a Link?
A **link** is another name or reference to a file or directory. There are two types:

### 1️⃣ Hard Link
- Points directly to the **inode** (file data)
- All hard links share the same inode
- File remains accessible as long as at least one hard link exists
- Cannot link to directories or across filesystems

### 2️⃣ Symbolic Link (Soft Link)
- Points to a **filename/path**
- Acts like a shortcut
- Can link to directories and across filesystems
- Broken if the target is deleted or moved

---

## 📁 Create Links with `ln`

### ✅ Hard Link:
```bash
ln original.txt hardlink.txt
```

### ✅ Symbolic Link:
```bash
ln -s original.txt symlink.txt
```

### 🔎 View Inode:
```bash
ls -i original.txt hardlink.txt
```
They will have the same inode for hard links.

---

## 🔍 Identifying Link Types

### Example:
```bash
ls -l
-rw------- 2 user user 9 Mar 6 11:37 original.txt
-rw------- 2 user user 9 Mar 6 11:37 hardlink.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 8 Mar 6 11:37 symlink.txt -> original.txt
```

- `-` = file
- `l` = symlink
- Hard links have the same inode and count
- Symlinks show arrow (`->`) to target

---

## 🧪 Behavior After Deletion
```bash
rm original.txt
cat hardlink.txt   # ✅ Works
cat symlink.txt    # ❌ Broken link (No such file or directory)
```

---

## 📌 Best Practices
- Prefer **hard links** when you want another name for the same file
- Prefer **symbolic links** for flexibility (point to paths, directories, cross-FS)

### 📎 Relative vs Absolute Symlinks
```bash
# Relative (may break if moved)
ln -s ../config.cfg ./link.cfg

# Absolute (preferred)
ln -s /etc/config.cfg ./link.cfg
```

---

## 🧹 Remove Links
```bash
rm linkname       # Works for all links
unlink linkname   # Also removes links
```

---

## 🔎 Find Symlinks
```bash
find /path -type l
```

---

## 🐍 Real Use Example
```bash
$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
$ ls -l /usr/bin/python3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Mar 25 2022 /usr/bin/python3 -> python3.10
```

Symlinks help point to the current version of tools/binaries.
