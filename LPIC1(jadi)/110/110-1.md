# LPIC-1: Session 36 - Perform Security Administration Tasks

## 🔐 Objectives
- Identify files with `suid`/`sgid`
- Manage user passwords and aging policies
- Use `netstat`, `nmap`, `lsof`, `fuser` for open port discovery
- Set user resource limits
- Monitor user logins and history
- Configure `sudo`

---

## 🧑‍💻 User Privilege Tools

### `su` vs `sudo`
- `su`: Switch to another user (requires **target** user's password)
- `sudo`: Run commands as root (asks for **your** password)

### `/etc/sudoers`
- Grants `sudo` access:
```bash
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
- Use `visudo` to edit safely.
- Example: Limit user to `ping` only:
```bash
username ALL=(ALL) /bin/ping
```

---

## 🧾 User Monitoring

### Logged-in Users
```bash
w       # Who's logged in + what they're doing
who     # Who is logged in
last    # Previous logins
last -f /var/log/btmp  # Failed logins
```

---

## 🔐 Password Management

### `passwd`
- Change user password
- Lock/unlock accounts:
```bash
passwd -l username   # Lock
passwd -u username   # Unlock
```
- View password status:
```bash
passwd -S username
```

### `chage`
- Manage password aging policies:
```bash
chage -l username     # View policy
sudo chage username   # Interactive mode
```

---

## 📂 SUID / SGID Files

### SUID (Set User ID)
- Run file as **file owner**, not executor:
```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/bin/passwd
```
- Discover SUID files:
```bash
sudo find / -perm -u+s
```

### SGID (Set Group ID)
- Run with **file's group** permissions.

⚠️ Dangerous if set on editors or shells!

---

## 🚦 User Limits

### `ulimit`
- Set per-shell resource limits:
```bash
ulimit -a         # View
ulimit -t 1       # Limit CPU time to 1s
```

### Persistent Limits
`/etc/security/limits.conf`:
```bash
*  soft  nproc  20
@faculty hard  nproc  50
```
- `soft`: User can change
- `hard`: Strict limit

---

## 🌐 Open Ports & Network Monitoring

### `netstat`
```bash
netstat -tuna    # View open/listening ports
```

### `ss`, `fuser`, `lsof`
- `ss`: Faster alternative to `netstat`
- `lsof -i`: Show open network connections
- `fuser 80/tcp -v`: Who uses port 80

### `nmap`
- Port scanner, discovery tool:
```bash
nmap localhost
```
