# LPIC-1: Session 17 - Maintain the Integrity of Filesystems

## 📌 Objectives
- Check and maintain file system integrity
- Monitor free disk space and inodes
- Use tools to repair and inspect filesystems (ext & XFS)

---

## 🧮 `df` - Disk Free
Shows disk space usage by mounted filesystems:
```bash
df -h     # Human-readable sizes
df -T     # Show filesystem types
df -i     # Show inode usage
```
Inodes track file metadata. Some filesystems (e.g. `vfat`) do not use inodes.

---

## 📦 `du` - Disk Usage
Shows how much space directories or files use:
```bash
du -h             # Human-readable
du -c             # Show total size
du -s             # Summary only
du --max-depth=1  # Limit directory depth
```
Useful for analyzing usage:
```bash
sudo du /home -h --max-depth 1
```

---

## 🛠️ `fsck` - Filesystem Check
Used to check and repair filesystems.
```bash
fsck /dev/sdX     # Check filesystem
fsck -N UUID=xxx  # Dry-run to preview actions
```
Unmount the device before checking it:
```bash
umount /dev/sdb1
fsck /dev/sdb1
```

You can also check by **UUID** or **LABEL**:
```bash
fsck UUID="XXXX"
fsck LABEL="data"
```

---

## 📂 Filesystem Superblock
The **superblock** holds metadata about the filesystem.
You can list backup superblock locations with:
```bash
mke2fs -n /dev/sda7
```
Use backup superblocks if the main one is corrupted:
```bash
e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/sda7
```

---

## 🔧 `e2fsck` - Check ext2/3/4 Filesystems
```bash
e2fsck /dev/sdaX       # Interactive check
e2fsck -n /dev/sdaX    # Read-only check
```

---

## 🛠️ `mke2fs` - Create ext2/ext3/ext4 Filesystem
Used to format a partition:
```bash
mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sdaX
```

---

## 🔄 `tune2fs` - Tune ext Filesystems
List or set filesystem settings:
```bash
tune2fs -l /dev/sdaX  # List filesystem info
```

---

## 🧪 `debugfs` - Debug ext Filesystems
Interactive tool to inspect ext2/3/4 internals:
```bash
debugfs /dev/sdaX
```
Useful for file recovery and inspecting inodes.

---

## 💾 `xfs` Tools (For XFS Filesystems)
| Command      | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `xfs_info`    | Display filesystem info (must be mounted) |
| `xfs_repair`  | Repair filesystem (must be unmounted) |
| `xfs_fsr`     | Defragment XFS files |
| `xfs_db`      | Debug/check XFS filesystem |
| `xfs_admin`   | Change XFS parameters |
| `xfs_growfs`  | Grow a mounted XFS filesystem |

```bash
xfs_repair /dev/sdX1
```

> You may need to install `xfsprogs` on some systems.

---

## 🔄 Mounting Use Cases
If a specific directory (like `/var/log`) grows too large, you can:
1. Create a new partition
2. Mount it on `/var/log`
3. Transfer the disk to another system and remount it there to access the logs

---

## ⚙️ `/etc/fstab` - Persistent Mounts
The `/etc/fstab` file defines how and where partitions should be mounted at boot.
You can use UUIDs for reliable mounting:
```bash
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /var/log  ext4  defaults  0  2
```
Use `blkid` to find UUIDs:
```bash
blkid
```
This enables consistent, automated mounting of disks with specific options.

---

## ✅ Summary
- Use `df` and `du` to monitor disk space and inodes
- Use `fsck`, `e2fsck`, `xfs_repair` to check and repair filesystems
- Tune and inspect filesystems with `tune2fs`, `debugfs`, and `xfs_info`
- Manage mounts with `/etc/fstab`, including UUID-based persistent configurations
- Use separate partitions (e.g. for `/var/log`) to manage space and transfer data easily

This concludes **Session 17** of LPIC-1! 🚀
