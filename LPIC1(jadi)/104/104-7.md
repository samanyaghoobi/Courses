# LPIC-1: Session 21 - Find System Files and Place Files in the Correct Location

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
- Locate files and commands efficiently
- Know correct placement of system/user/application files

---

## 📂 Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

| Directory | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/`      | Root of the entire file system |
| `/bin`   | Essential user binaries (e.g. `ls`, `cp`) |
| `/boot`  | Boot loader files (e.g. kernel) |
| `/dev`   | Device files |
| `/etc`   | Host-specific system configuration |
| `/home`  | User home directories |
| `/lib`   | Essential shared libraries |
| `/media` | Mount point for removable media |
| `/mnt`   | Mount point for temporary mounts |
| `/opt`   | Add-on software packages |
| `/sbin`  | Essential system binaries |
| `/srv`   | Service data (e.g. FTP, HTTP) |
| `/tmp`   | Temporary files |
| `/usr`   | Secondary hierarchy (shareable, read-only) |
| `/var`   | Variable data (e.g. logs, spool files) |
| `/root`  | Home directory of root user |

## 📜 Environment PATH

```bash
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```
The shell searches these directories (left to right) for executables.

Add new path:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir
```

---

## 🔍 File Location Tools

### ✅ `which`
- Finds executable in `$PATH`
```bash
which ping
```

### ✅ `type`
- Shows if something is a binary, alias, function, or shell builtin
```bash
type cd
type for
```

### ✅ `whereis`
- Finds binary, source, and man page
```bash
whereis mkfs
```

---

## 🔎 `find` Command

Find files by name, type, owner, size, and more:
```bash
find /etc -name "*ssh*"
find . -type l       # Find symbolic links
find . ! -user jadi  # Not owned by jadi
find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -user root
```

Find orphaned files:
```bash
find / -nouser -o -nogroup
```

---

## ⚡ `locate` & `updatedb`

Faster alternative to `find`, uses an index:
```bash
locate config
```

Update the index (usually run via cron):
```bash
sudo updatedb
```

Exclude paths via `/etc/updatedb.conf`
```bash
PRUNEPATHS="/tmp /media /home/.ecryptfs"
```

---

## ✅ Summary of Search Tools

| Command   | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| `find`    | Live, precise, flexible searches |
| `locate`  | Very fast, pre-indexed search |
| `which`   | Find executables in PATH |
| `type`    | Identify command type (alias, binary, etc.) |
| `whereis` | Find binaries + man pages + source |
