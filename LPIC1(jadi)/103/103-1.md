# LPIC-1: Session 9 - Work on the Command Line

## üìå Objectives
- Execute single shell commands and one-liners
- Modify the shell environment using environment variables
- Use and edit command history
- Locate and execute commands inside and outside the defined path

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Shells and Bash
A **shell** is a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. The most commonly used shell in Linux is **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**.

### **Checking Your Shell**
```bash
echo $SHELL
```

To find where `sh` points:
```bash
readlink /bin/sh
```

### **Checking If a Command is Built-in or External**
```bash
type cd  # Built-in shell command
type ls  # External command (aliased or binary)
type ping  # Executable file location
```

---

## üìÇ Navigating Directories
### **Changing Directory (cd)**
```bash
cd /home/user  # Absolute path
cd Documents  # Relative path
cd ~  # Move to home directory
cd -  # Move to the previous directory
```

### **Displaying Current Directory (pwd)**
```bash
pwd
```

### **System Information (uname)**
```bash
uname -a  # Show all system information
uname -r  # Show kernel version
uname -m  # Show system architecture
```

---

## üìñ Getting Help
### **Using the Manual (man)**
```bash
man ls  # Display manual for 'ls'
man 5 passwd  # Show section 5 of passwd manual
```

### **Searching Commands in Path**
```bash
which ls  # Find the location of an executable
whereis ls  # Find binary, source, and manual pages
```

---

## üî§ Special Characters & Quoting
Some characters have special meanings in Bash and must be **escaped** to be used literally.

### **Escaping Characters**
```bash
echo 2 \* 3 = 6  # Outputs: 2 * 3 = 6
```
### **Quoting Methods**
| Method | Example | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Backslash (`\`) | `echo \$HOME` | Escape a single character |
| Single Quotes (`'`) | `'Hello $USER'` | Prevent variable expansion |
| Double Quotes (`"`) | `"Hello $USER"` | Allow variable expansion |

---

## üåç Environment Variables
Environment variables store system-wide settings and configurations.

### **Displaying Environment Variables**
```bash
echo $HOME  # Show home directory
env  # Show all environment variables
```

### **Defining and Exporting Variables**
```bash
MYVAR="Hello World"  # Define a variable
echo $MYVAR  # Use the variable
export MYVAR  # Make it available to child processes
unset MYVAR  # Remove the variable
```

Common environment variables:
| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `$USER` | Current logged-in user |
| `$HOME` | User home directory |
| `$PATH` | Directories for searching executables |
| `$PWD` | Current working directory |

---

## üîé Command Search Path
When executing a command, Bash searches the directories listed in `$PATH`.

### **Checking the Path**
```bash
echo $PATH
```
### **Finding Command Locations**
```bash
which ls  # First matching binary in $PATH
type ls  # Show alias or built-in type
```

---

## ‚è≥ Command History
Bash keeps a history of executed commands, stored in `~/.bash_history`.

### **Using Command History**
```bash
history  # Show command history
!100  # Run command #100
!!  # Run last command
!ls  # Run last 'ls' command
```

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Up/Down` | Browse history |
| `Ctrl+R` | Search history backwards |
| `Ctrl+O` | Run found command from `Ctrl+R` |

To clear history:
```bash
history -c  # Clear session history
```

---

## ‚ùå Exiting the Shell
To exit the shell, use:
```bash
exit  # Exit the shell
```
Or press `Ctrl+D`.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Bash** is the most common shell in Linux.
- Use `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls` to navigate the filesystem.
- `uname` provides system information.
- `man` and `which` help find command details.
- Environment variables are managed using `export` and `unset`.
- Command history is stored in `~/.bash_history` and accessed with `history`.
