# LPIC-1: Session 18 - Control Mounting and Unmounting of Filesystems

## 📌 Objectives
- Mount and unmount filesystems manually
- Configure automatic mounts at boot
- Use UUIDs and labels for reliable mounts
- Support removable user-mountable devices
- Understand systemd mount units

---

## 🔗 Mounting and Unmounting Filesystems
In Linux, a filesystem must be mounted to be accessible. For example:
```bash
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /media/mydisk
```
To unmount:
```bash
sudo umount /media/mydisk
# or
sudo umount /dev/sda3
```

> `/media` and `/mnt` are commonly used mount points, but you can use any directory.

You can remount an already mounted filesystem with options:
```bash
sudo mount -o remount,ro /dev/sda1
```

---

## 🆔 UUIDs and Labels
Device names like `/dev/sda1` can change. It's more stable to use **UUIDs** or **labels**.

### 🔍 View UUIDs:
```bash
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,UUID
blkid
```

### ⛓️ Mount using UUID:
```bash
sudo mount UUID=4c1a51e6-47bf-4a34-84a2-87027c91e14a /media/mydisk/
```

---

## ⚙️ `/etc/fstab` - Persistent Mounts
Linux uses `/etc/fstab` to automatically mount filesystems at boot.

### 🧾 Sample `/etc/fstab` Entry:
```fstab
UUID=xxxx-xxxx  /var/log  ext4  defaults  0  2
```

| Column       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| File system  | UUID, LABEL, or device path |
| Mount point  | Where to mount (e.g. `/mnt/data`) |
| Type         | Filesystem type (`ext4`, `xfs`, `btrfs`, etc) |
| Options      | `defaults`, `noexec`, `noatime`, etc. |
| Dump         | Used by `dump` command (usually `0`) |
| Pass         | Filesystem check order during boot |

Run this after editing fstab:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
```

> Use `noatime` to improve performance by skipping access time updates.

---

## 🖥️ Removable Drives and User Mounts
Modern desktops usually handle USB mounts via `udisks2`, but you can allow user-mountable drives manually via `/etc/fstab`:
```fstab
UUID=XXXX /media/usbdrive vfat noauto,user 0 0
```

### ⚠️ Note
- Use `user` to allow mounting by normal users
- Without `exec`, binaries won't be executable

---

## 🪢 `mount` and `umount`
List all mounted filesystems:
```bash
mount
```
Mount ISO files:
```bash
sudo mount -o loop image.iso /mnt/iso
```
Unmount with:
```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdX1
sudo umount /mnt/point
```

> Swap filesystems are activated with `swapon` and deactivated with `swapoff`

---

## 🧾 systemd Mount Units
Systemd can manage mount points using `.mount` unit files.

Example: `/etc/systemd/system/media-mydisk.mount`
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Mount MyDisk

[Mount]
What=/dev/sda3
Where=/media/mydisk
Type=ext4
Options=defaults

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable it:
```bash
systemctl enable media-mydisk.mount
```

---

## ✅ Summary
- Use `mount` and `umount` to manage filesystems manually
- Reference UUIDs/Labels using `lsblk` or `blkid`
- Configure `/etc/fstab` for persistent mounts
- `user` and `noauto` allow safe user mounts for USB drives
- Learn systemd mount units for advanced configuration
