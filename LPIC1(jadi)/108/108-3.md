## 📫 What is an MTA?
Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) handle sending and receiving emails on Unix/Linux systems. They manage:
- Local message delivery between users
- Remote email delivery

Popular MTAs include:

| MTA       | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Postfix** | Modern, secure, default in most distros |
| **Sendmail** | Oldest, hard to configure |
| **Exim** | Feature-rich, flexible, ACL-based |

> 💡 Desktop distros often skip installing MTAs by default.

## 📩 Email Aliases (`/etc/aliases`)
Defines aliases for system mail accounts:

```bash
# Example: /etc/aliases
postmaster: root
news: root
www: webmaster
webmaster: root
```

After changes:
```bash
sudo newaliases
```

---

## 📨 Sending Local Mail with `mail`
```bash
mail username
Subject: Hello
This is a local email.
.
Cc:
```

View inbox:
```bash
mail
```

---

## 🔁 Local Forwarding with `~/.forward`
Each user can forward their mail:
```bash
# ~/.forward
jadijadi@gmail.com
```

This forwards all incoming mail to the specified address.

---

## 📬 Mail Queue: `mailq`
Check undelivered messages:
```bash
mailq
```
Example output:
```bash
AA52C228E6B  jadi@funlife → jadijadi@gmail.com
(connect to gmail failed...)
```

---

## 🔧 Sendmail Emulation Layer
Commands like `sendmail`, `mail`, `mailq`, etc., are provided by all major MTAs for compatibility.
