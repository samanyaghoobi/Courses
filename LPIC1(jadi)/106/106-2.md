# LPIC-1: Session 25 - Graphical Desktops

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand major Linux desktop environments
- Learn methods for accessing remote desktop sessions

---

## 🖥️ Desktop Environments
A Desktop Environment (DE) includes a window manager, icons, panels, settings, apps, and more to provide a full user experience.

### 🧱 Window Manager vs Desktop Environment
- **Window Manager**: Minimal system to manage open windows (move, resize, etc.)
- **Desktop Environment**: Full GUI suite including file manager, panels, utilities, etc.

### 🪟 Popular Desktop Environments

#### 🔵 GNOME
- Started: 1999
- Focus: Simplicity, productivity, accessibility
- Default on many major distros (e.g., Fedora, Ubuntu)

#### 🟣 KDE Plasma
- Started: 1996 (Plasma from version 5 in 2016)
- Focus: Customization and performance
- Used in NASA and CERN

#### 🟢 XFCE
- Started: 1999
- Focus: Lightweight, modular, suitable for older hardware

## 🌐 Remote Access to GUI Sessions

### 🔁 XDMCP
- **X Display Manager Control Protocol**
- Handles graphical logins over the network
- Used by display managers like **GDM**, **SDDM**, **XDM**

### 🚀 X Forwarding via SSH (Bonus Tip)
```bash
# Ensure X11 forwarding is enabled in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
X11Forwarding yes

# Then connect from client:
ssh -X user@remotehost
xeyes  # GUI opens on your local machine
```

### 📺 VNC
- **Virtual Network Computing** using **RFB** protocol
- Default port: `5900 + display number`
- Pros: Simple, cross-platform
- Cons: No encryption by default

### 🔥 Spice
- Originally closed source, now open via RedHat
- Fast and lightweight
- Often used with KVM virtual machines

### 💻 RDP
- **Remote Desktop Protocol**, enabled with tools like **xrdp**
- Default port: `3389`
- Encrypted by default, compatible with many clients
