# LPIC-1: Session 13 - Modify Process Execution Priorities

## üìå Objectives
- Understand the default priority of processes
- Run programs with higher or lower priority
- Change the priority of a running process

---

## üî¢ Understanding Process Priorities
In Linux, each process has a **priority level** that determines how much CPU time it gets. The **niceness value (NI)** ranges from **-20** (highest priority) to **19** (lowest priority).

You can check process priorities using `top`:
```bash
top
```
The **NI** column in `top` shows the process niceness.

Alternatively, use `ps`:
```bash
ps -l
```
Example output:
```bash
F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
0 S  1000 15044 15035  0  80   0 -  7453 wait   pts/29   00:00:00 bash
0 S  1000 15052 15044  0  60 -20 -  3976 hrtime pts/29   00:00:00 sleep
0 R  1000 15080 15044  0  80   0 -  4680 -      pts/29   00:00:00 ps
```

## üéõÔ∏è Setting Process Priorities
### **Using `nice` to Start a Process with a Specific Priority**
```bash
nice -n 10 command  # Start a process with lower priority
nice -n -10 command  # Start with higher priority (requires root)
```
Example:
```bash
nice -n 19 echo "I am running with low priority"
```
By default, running `nice` without `-n` sets the priority to **10**.

---

## üîÑ Changing Priorities of Running Processes
### **Using `renice` to Adjust Priority**
```bash
renice -n 5 -p <PID>  # Increase niceness (lower priority)
renice -n -10 -p <PID>  # Decrease niceness (higher priority, requires root)
```
Example:
```bash
ps -ef | grep firefox  # Find PID of Firefox
sudo renice -10 -p 13605  # Increase priority of Firefox
```

You can also **press `r` in `top`** to renice a process interactively.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Process priorities** range from `-20` (high priority) to `19` (low priority).
- **Use `nice`** to start a process with a specific priority.
- **Use `renice`** to change the priority of a running process.
- **Monitor priorities** using `top` and `ps`.
