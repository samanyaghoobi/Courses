# LPIC-1: Session 12 - Create, Monitor, and Kill Processes

## üìå Objectives
- Run jobs in **foreground** and **background**
- Continue jobs after logout
- Monitor active processes
- Sort and filter processes
- Send signals to processes

---

## üèóÔ∏è Managing Processes
### **Running Jobs in the Foreground and Background**
By default, when you run a command, it **blocks** the terminal. However, you can send a process to the **background** using `&`:
```bash
xeyes &  # Run xeyes in the background
```

### **Stopping and Resuming Jobs**
- `Ctrl + C`: Terminates a running process.
- `Ctrl + Z`: Suspends a running process.
- `jobs`: Lists background and stopped jobs.
- `fg %1`: Brings job **1** to the foreground.
- `bg %1`: Resumes job **1** in the background.

Example:
```bash
$ sleep 1000 &
[1] 7395
$ jobs
[1]+ Running sleep 1000 &
$ fg %1  # Bring sleep 1000 to foreground
sleep 1000
^Z  # Press Ctrl+Z to stop it
$ bg %1  # Resume in background
```

---

## üîÑ Keeping Jobs Alive After Logout
### **Using `nohup` to Prevent Job Termination**
```bash
nohup ping 8.8.8.8 > output.log &  # Run and log output
```
- `nohup.out` stores the output by default.
- Redirect stderr separately: `nohup script.sh > output.log 2>&1 &`

---

## üõë Killing Processes
### **Using `kill` to Send Signals**
By default, `kill` sends **SIGTERM (15)**, which allows processes to exit gracefully.
```bash
kill -15 <PID>  # Graceful termination
kill -9 <PID>  # Forcefully kill a process
```

### **Using `killall`, `pkill`, and `pgrep`**
- `killall process_name` - Kills all processes with a given name.
- `pkill pattern` - Kills processes matching a pattern.
- `pgrep process_name` - Lists process IDs matching a name.

Example:
```bash
pkill -9 firefox  # Force kill all Firefox processes
pgrep -l firefox  # List Firefox process IDs
```

---

## üîç Monitoring Processes
### **`ps` - List Processes**
```bash
ps aux  # Show all processes
ps -ef  # Alternative format
```

### **Sorting Processes**
```bash
ps -eo pid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%mem  # Sort by memory usage
```

### **`top` - Interactive Process Viewer**
```bash
top  # Real-time process monitoring
```
Common **`top`** shortcuts:
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Help |
| `q` | Quit |
| `M` | Sort by memory usage |
| `P` | Sort by CPU usage |
| `k` | Kill a process |

### **`free` - Check Memory Usage**
```bash
free -h  # Show available memory in human-readable format
```

### **`uptime` - System Load & Uptime**
```bash
uptime  # Show system uptime and load averages
```

---

## ‚è≥ Continuous Monitoring with `watch`
```bash
watch -n 1 free -h  # Update free memory every second
watch "ls -ltrh | wc -l"  # Monitor number of files in a directory
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal Multiplexing
### **Using `screen`**
```bash
screen  # Start a new session
screen -ls  # List running screen sessions
screen -r <session_id>  # Reattach to a session
```

### **Using `tmux` (Advanced Alternative)**
```bash
tmux new -s my_session  # Create a new session
tmux attach -t my_session  # Reattach to session
tmux list-sessions  # List sessions
```

Common **`tmux`** shortcuts:
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+B %` | Split vertically |
| `Ctrl+B "` | Split horizontally |
| `Ctrl+B D` | Detach from session |
| `Ctrl+B X` | Kill current pane |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Use `&`, `fg`, `bg`, and `jobs`** to manage running processes.
- **Use `nohup`** to keep processes running after logout.
- **Kill processes** with `kill`, `killall`, `pkill`, and `pgrep`.
- **Monitor processes** with `ps`, `top`, and `free`.
- **Use `watch`** to run commands continuously.
- **Use `screen` and `tmux`** to manage terminal sessions.
