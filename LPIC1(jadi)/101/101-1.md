# LPIC-1: Session 1 - Determining and Configuring Hardware Settings

## üìå Objectives
- Enable and disable integrated peripherals
- Differentiate between mass storage devices
- Determine hardware resources for devices
- Tools and utilities to list hardware information
- Tools and utilities to manipulate USB devices
- Understanding **sysfs**, **udev**, and **dbus**

## üñ•Ô∏è Operating System & Firmware
### Operating System (OS)
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for applications.

### Firmware
**Firmware** is software embedded in hardware, acting as a built-in OS or driver for the hardware. Examples include **BIOS** and **UEFI**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è BIOS vs. UEFI
| Feature | BIOS | UEFI |
|---------|------|------|
| Stands for | Basic Input/Output System | Unified Extensible Firmware Interface |
| Introduced | Old, now outdated | Introduced in 1998 by Intel |
| Boot Process | Reads first sector of the first partition (MBR) | Uses a dedicated EFI System Partition (ESP) |
| Boot Partition | Uses MBR | Uses **/boot/efi** with FAT filesystem |
| Bootloader | Loads bootloader into memory | Stores all boot-related files inside ESP |
| Extensibility | Limited | Highly extendable with additional features |

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Access in Linux
Linux provides multiple ways to access hardware:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ sysfs (`/sys` directory)**
- A **pseudo-filesystem** that exposes kernel and hardware information.
- Located at `/sys`, it allows users to view device details.
- Example:
  ```bash
  ls /sys
  ```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `/dev` Directory**
- Stores device files corresponding to hardware components.
- Example:
  ```bash
  ls /dev
  ```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ dbus (`/dbus` directory)**
- Handles **inter-process communication (IPC)**, allowing processes to exchange messages efficiently.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ procfs (`/proc` directory)**
- Stores kernel settings, IRQ, DMA, and I/O port mappings.
- Example:
  ```bash
  ls /proc
  ```
- Important files:
  - `/proc/irq/` - Interrupt requests
  - `/proc/dma/` - Direct Memory Access
  - `/proc/ioports/` - I/O port mappings

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ `/etc` Directory**
- Stores system configuration files to make changes persistent across reboots.

## üîå Peripheral Devices
### PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
- Expansion slots for adding hardware components.
- Common types:
  - **PATA/SATA/SCSI** (Internal HDD)
  - **Fiber, USB SSD** (External HDD)
  - **Network cards** (RJ-45, WiFi, Bluetooth)
  - **Graphics and Audio cards**

### Storage Devices: **SSD vs HDD**
| Feature | SSD | HDD |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Noise | Silent | Noisy (Moving parts) |
| Durability | More durable | Less durable |
| Energy Consumption | Lower | Higher |
| Cost | More expensive | Cheaper |

### **Network vs. Wireless Cards**
| Feature | Network Card (NIC) | Wireless Card |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Connectivity | Uses Ethernet (RJ45) | Uses WiFi (802.11) |
| Mobility | Fixed | Portable |

### **USB (Universal Serial Bus)**
| USB Version | Speed |
|------------|-------|
| USB 1.0 | 12 Mbps |
| USB 2.0 | 480 Mbps |
| USB 3.0 | 5 Gbps |
| USB 3.2 | 20 Gbps |
| USB 4.0 | 40 Gbps |

### **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)**
- Used for **controlling other devices** (e.g., **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino**).

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Hardware Utilities
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lsusb` | Lists all USB devices connected to the system. |
| `lspci` | Lists all PCI devices. |
| `lsblk` | Displays block storage devices (HDD, SSD, etc.). |
| `lshw` | Shows detailed hardware information. |

Example:
```bash
lspci
lsusb
lsblk
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Kernel Modules and Drivers
Linux uses **Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM)** to manage hardware drivers.

### **Kernel Module Management**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lsmod` | Lists currently loaded kernel modules. |
| `modinfo <module>` | Displays information about a module. |
| `rmmod <module>` | Removes a kernel module. |
| `modprobe <module>` | Loads a module automatically. |

Example:
```bash
lsmod
modinfo iwlwifi
rmmod iwlwifi
modprobe iwlwifi
```

### **Making Module Changes Persistent**
- Add module name to `/etc/modules`.
- Add configuration files in `/etc/modprobe.d/`.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Firmware vs OS**: Firmware is built into hardware, while OS manages system resources.
- **BIOS vs UEFI**: UEFI is modern and more flexible, whereas BIOS is legacy.
- **Linux Hardware Access**: Uses `/sys`, `/dev`, `/proc`, and `udev` for device management.
- **Peripheral Devices**: PCI, HDD, SSD, USB, GPIO, NIC, and wireless cards.
- **Kernel Modules**: Managed using `lsmod`, `modinfo`, `rmmod`, and `modprobe`.
