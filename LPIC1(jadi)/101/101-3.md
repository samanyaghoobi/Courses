# LPIC-1: Session 3 - Change Runlevels / Boot Targets and Shutdown or Reboot the System

## üìå Objectives
- Understand **SysVinit runlevels** and **systemd boot targets**
- Learn how to **change runlevels/targets** including **single-user mode**
- Properly **shutdown and reboot** the system
- Notify users before major system changes using `wall`
- Work with **ACPI power management**

## üèóÔ∏è Runlevels & Boot Targets
### **SysVinit Runlevels**
Runlevels define the system‚Äôs state:

| Runlevel | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **0** | Shutdown |
| **1 (S/s)** | Single-user mode (Recovery mode) |
| **2** | Multi-user mode without networking |
| **3** | Multi-user mode with networking |
| **4** | Custom (Not used by default) |
| **5** | Multi-user mode with GUI |
| **6** | Reboot |

To check the **current runlevel**:
```bash
runlevel
```
To change the **runlevel**:
```bash
telinit 3  # Switch to multi-user mode
init 0      # Shutdown the system
```

### **systemd Boot Targets**
With **systemd**, runlevels are replaced with **targets**:

| Target | Equivalent Runlevel | Description |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **poweroff.target** | 0 | Shutdown the system |
| **rescue.target** | 1 | Single-user mode |
| **multi-user.target** | 3 | Multi-user mode with networking |
| **graphical.target** | 5 | Multi-user mode with GUI |
| **reboot.target** | 6 | Reboot the system |

To check the **current target**:
```bash
systemctl get-default
```
To switch to another target:
```bash
systemctl isolate multi-user.target  # Switch to CLI mode
```

## üîÑ Shutting Down and Rebooting
### **Using `shutdown` command**
The `shutdown` command sends warnings and properly stops all processes before shutting down.

Syntax:
```bash
shutdown -h now      # Shutdown immediately
shutdown -r +10      # Reboot in 10 minutes
shutdown -c         # Cancel a scheduled shutdown
shutdown -r 60 "System maintenance"  # Notify users before rebooting
```

### **Using `halt`, `poweroff`, and `reboot`**
```bash
halt      # Stop all processes and halt CPU
poweroff  # Halt and send ACPI poweroff signal
reboot    # Halt and reboot the system
```

These commands are linked to **systemctl**:
```bash
systemctl poweroff
systemctl reboot
```

---

## üì¢ User Notifications
To notify users before system changes:
- **Using `wall` command**:
  ```bash
  wall "System maintenance in 10 minutes!"
  ```
- **Restricting logins**:
  - Once `shutdown` starts, only root can log in.
- **Custom system messages**:
  - `/etc/issue`: Shown **before login** on local terminals.
  - `/etc/issue.net`: Shown **before remote login** (SSH users).
  - `/etc/motd`: Message displayed **after successful login** (often legal notices).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
ACPI handles power management:
- Enables **auto power-off** after shutdown.
- Supports **sleep modes and hot-plugging**.
- Works with commands like `poweroff` and `shutdown`.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **SysVinit runlevels** and **systemd targets** define the system state.
- Use `telinit` or `systemctl isolate` to change runlevels/targets.
- Use `shutdown`, `halt`, and `poweroff` to stop the system properly.
- Notify users using `wall`, `/etc/issue`, and `/etc/motd`.
- **ACPI** manages power events, allowing automatic shutdown and sleep modes.
