# LPIC-1: Session 2 - Boot the System

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the boot process from **BIOS/UEFI** to **boot completion**
- Learn about **bootloaders** and their role
- Explore **init systems** (SysVinit, Upstart, systemd)
- Check boot logs using `dmesg`, `journalctl`

---

## 🏗️ Boot Process Overview
1. **Firmware Initialization (BIOS/UEFI)**
   - **BIOS**: Loads the first sector of the disk (MBR) to execute the bootloader.
   - **UEFI**: Uses the EFI System Partition (ESP) to locate and execute the bootloader.
   - If the system boots using **EFI**, `/sys/firmware/efi` will be available.

2. **Bootloader Execution**
   - The **bootloader** (e.g., GRUB1, GRUB2) locates and loads the **Linux kernel**.
   - It can load an **OS** or any file it can interact with.

3. **Kernel Initialization**
   - The **kernel** is loaded into memory and executed.
   - It requires **essential drivers** and configurations stored in `initrd` or `initramfs`.

4. **System Initialization**
   - The kernel mounts the root filesystem and starts the **init** process.
   - The **init** system manages service startup and dependencies (e.g., networking, login screen, etc.).

## 🔹 Bootloaders
- **GRUB (GRUB1, GRUB2 - last 10 years)**
- Can read disks, locate the kernel, and load it.
- Common bootloader commands are stored in configuration files.

---

## 📝 Boot Messages & Logs
- To view boot logs **during startup**, press `ESC`.
- To analyze boot logs **after startup**, use:
  ```bash
  dmesg
  ```
  - Reads the **kernel ring buffer**, which contains boot messages.
  - Logs are also stored at `/var/log/dmesg`.

- `journalctl` is used for checking systemd logs:
  ```bash
  journalctl -b  # View boot logs
  journalctl -k  # View kernel logs
  ```

## 🔄 Init Systems
| Init System | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **SysVinit** | Old Unix-based system, uses `/etc/init.d/` scripts |
| **Upstart**  | Event-driven system by Canonical (used in old Ubuntu) |
| **systemd**  | Modern standard, used in almost all Linux distributions |

To check which **init** system is in use:
```bash
which init
readlink -f /sbin/init
```
Example output for **systemd**:
```bash
/usr/sbin/init -> ../lib/systemd/systemd
```

---

## ⚙️ Managing systemd Units
- **Units** define services, mounts, devices, etc.
- Located in priority order:
  1. `/etc/systemd/system/`
  2. `/run/systemd/system/`
  3. `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`

- Useful commands:
  ```bash
  systemctl list-unit-files  # List available units
  systemctl cat <unit_name>  # Show details of a specific unit
  ```

---

## ✅ Summary
- **Firmware (BIOS/UEFI)** initializes the system and executes the **bootloader**.
- **Bootloader (GRUB2)** loads the **kernel** and starts the system.
- **Kernel** loads essential drivers (`initrd`/`initramfs`) and starts the **init system**.
- **systemd** is the dominant init system in modern Linux distributions.
- **Logs** can be checked with `dmesg` and `journalctl`.
