# LPIC-1: Session 26 - Accessibility in Linux

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand accessibility needs and technologies
- Identify assistive features in Linux desktops
- Recognize key tools and options for users with disabilities

---

## 🌍 Linux is for Everyone
Linux provides multiple accessibility options for users with visual or physical disabilities. These tools fall under three main categories:

1. **AccessX** - Assists with physical impairments (keyboard/mouse behavior)
2. **Visual Settings** - Helps users with vision problems (themes, magnifiers)
3. **Assistive Technologies** - Screen readers, TTS, Braille displays, etc.
