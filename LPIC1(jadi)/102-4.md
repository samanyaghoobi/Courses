# LPIC-1: Session 6 - Debian Package Management

## 📌 Objectives
- Manage **Debian packages** using `dpkg` and `apt`
- Find and install missing dependencies
- Configure package sources and repositories
- Reconfigure installed packages

---

## 📂 Debian Package Management System
Unlike manual compilation, **Debian-based** systems use a **package manager** to install, update, and remove software efficiently. The package manager ensures:
- **Automatic dependency resolution**
- **Centralized repositories** for software
- **Easy upgrades and removals**

### **Debian Package File Format**
A package in Debian is stored as a **`.deb`** file:
```
PACKAGE_NAME-VERSION-RELEASE_ARCH.deb
```
Example:
```
tmux_3.2a-4build1_amd64.deb
```

---

## 📌 Managing Repositories
Package sources are stored in:
- `/etc/apt/sources.list`
- `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`

Example **sources.list**:
```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```
```bash
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security main restricted universe multiverse
```
- These URLs tell `apt` where to **fetch packages** from.

To update package lists:
```bash
sudo apt-get update  # Updates package index (does not upgrade software)
```

---

## 📥 Installing Packages
### **Install a package**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tmux
```
- **Automatically resolves dependencies**.
- If using `dpkg`, dependencies **won’t** be resolved:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i tmux_3.2a-4build1_amd64.deb
```
- To fix dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -f  # Installs missing dependencies
```

### **Simulate an Installation (Dry Run)**
```bash
sudo apt-get install -s tmux  # Simulates installation
```

### **Download Package Without Installing**
```bash
sudo apt-get install --download-only tmux
```
Downloaded packages are stored in:
```
/var/cache/apt/archives/
```

---

## 📤 Removing Packages
### **Remove a package (keep configs)**
```bash
sudo apt-get remove tmux
```
### **Completely remove a package + configs**
```bash
sudo apt-get purge tmux
```
### **Remove unnecessary dependencies**
```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

---

## 🔎 Searching for Packages
### **Find a package by name**
```bash
apt-cache search "tiny window"
```
### **View package info**
```bash
apt info tmux
```

---

## 🔄 Upgrading Packages
### **Upgrade a single package**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tzdata
```
### **Upgrade all installed packages**
```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
### **Perform a full system upgrade**
```bash
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

---

## 🔧 Reconfiguring Installed Packages
Some packages prompt for settings **after installation**. To reconfigure:
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata  # Re-run timezone setup
```

---

## 🛠️ Working with `dpkg`
### **List all installed packages**
```bash
dpkg -l
```
### **Check details of an installed package**
```bash
dpkg -s tmux
```
### **Find which package installed a file**
```bash
dpkg -S /usr/bin/tmux
```
### **List all files inside a package**
```bash
dpkg -L tmux
```

---

## ✅ Summary
- **`apt-get`** manages packages with dependency resolution.
- **`dpkg`** works with `.deb` files but does **not** resolve dependencies.
- **`/etc/apt/sources.list`** stores repository sources.
- **`apt-get update`** refreshes the package index.
- **`apt-get upgrade` & `apt-get dist-upgrade`** upgrade installed packages.
- **`dpkg-reconfigure`** allows reconfiguring installed packages.
